# Unclosed Parenthesis Bug in Python

This repository demonstrates a common but easily missed error in Python: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  This results in a `SyntaxError` and prevents the code from running correctly.

The `unclosed_paren_bug.py` file contains the buggy code. The `unclosed_paren_solution.py` file shows the corrected version.

This simple example highlights the importance of careful code review and the use of a good IDE or linter to catch such syntax errors early in the development process.
